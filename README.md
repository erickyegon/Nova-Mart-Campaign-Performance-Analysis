# Nova Mart Campaign Performance Analysis
## Retail Promotion Effectiveness Study

# Project Background
As a data analyst at Nova Mart, I am analyzing the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns across southern India. Nova Mart operates 50 stores and specializes in providing quality products to diverse customer segments, with a focus on Nova-branded products.

The analysis focuses on two major promotional campaigns:
* Diwali Campaign 2023
* Sankranti Campaign 2024

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Revenue Impact:** Analysis of revenue changes across categories and locations
- **Store Performance:** Geographic performance variations and store-level metrics
- **Category Analysis:** Product category distribution and growth patterns
- **Price Sensitivity:** Price-volume relationships and promotional effectiveness

The analysis was performed using Python, leveraging pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations, and numpy for statistical computations. The complete analysis notebook can be found here [link to Jupyter notebook].

# Data Structure & Initial Checks

The analysis utilizes multiple data sources tracking campaign performance across various dimensions:

- **Sales Data:** Pre and post-promotion sales metrics
- **Store Information:** Location and performance data
- **Product Data:** Category hierarchies and pricing information
- **Campaign Metrics:** Promotion types and effectiveness measures

The pre-promotion sales distribution analysis reveals interesting patterns across categories:
